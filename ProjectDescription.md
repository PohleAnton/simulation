# Project 1: 
## Simulate Social Platform With Generative Agents

- Provide initial description of agent (possibly hobbies, interests, CV, goals, etc.)
- For each member, decide to have conversation (on a daily basis)
- Feed conversation into memory stream
- Generate summary and feed into memory stream
- Rate each entry how interesting it was
- Generate higher-level reflections per chat partner and across chat partners
- Retrieve relevant content for conversations (history for particular member, higher-level reflections from other conversations, etc.)
- Allow user feedback/input
- Goal could be to generate as deep conversations as possible (evaluation via LLM)
