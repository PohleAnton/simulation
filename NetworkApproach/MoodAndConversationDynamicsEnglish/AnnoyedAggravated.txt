Irritated/Aggravated:

Communication tends to be brief with responses and interruptions, tensions can escalate easily, and nonverbal communication often becomes negative, such as through eye-rolling or crossed arms.
Sarcasm and cynicism occur more frequently, and there's a decreased willingness to continue the conversation constructively or to understand the other's perspective.
